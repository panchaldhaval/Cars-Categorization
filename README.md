# Cars-Categorization

This claasification is based on Sub four meter/ lenth of the car.

Sub four meter is 4000.
if the car length is more than 4000, the cost will be higher so it won't be suitable for small/poor family.

if the Sub four meter/ car length is less than 4000 then the car price will be lower and it will be having 5 seater capacity so it is suitable for small family.

so created two claases in claasification
